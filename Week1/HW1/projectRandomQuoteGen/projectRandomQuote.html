  <h1> Evina's Random Quote Generator</h1>  
  <!-- instead of BIO -->
  <h2>Aspects of the Project</h2>
  <p>This is an attempt to create a simple quote generator. It was created during a coding class at Social Hacker's Academy. It was part of homework originally and came with these instructions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Include at least 1 JavaScript, CSS and HTML file.</li>
    <li>No CSS frameworks allowed.</li>
    <li>Each time the button is clicked it should show a random quote.</li>
    <li>Create a function that fires after the button click.</li>
    <li>Collect 6 of your favorite quotes (quote and author) and store them in the right data structure.</li>
  </ul>


  <div id="quoteHolder"></div>  
 <button onclick="addQuote()">New Quote!</button>
</div>
<script src= "projectRandomQuote.js"></script> 
</body>
